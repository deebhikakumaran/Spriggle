## Overview

Spriggle is a B2C platform that directly connects rural producers with urban consumers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair compensation for authentic rural products. By leveraging technology, Spriggle empowers rural innovators, delivers quality-assured goods to city dwellers, and fosters sustainable rural development.

## Problem

- **Dependence on Intermediaries:** Rural producers are forced to rely on middlemen for sales and distribution, losing direct access to markets.
- **Unfair Value Capture:** Middlemen absorb 70-80% of the final retail price, significantly underpaying producers.
- **Urban-Rural Disconnect:** Urban consumers lack access to authentic rural products and remain disconnected from their origins, quality, and cultural value.

---

## Solution

Spriggle bridges the gap by providing:

- **Verified Rural Sellers:** Only authentic, vetted rural producers are onboarded, ensuring quality and traceability.
- **Transparent Pricing Model:** Producers retain 70-80% of the final sales value, removing exploitative middlemen.
- **Mobile-First Platform:** User-friendly, multilingual app accessible to both rural and urban users.
- **End-to-End Supply Chain Integration:** Real-time inventory, order tracking, and delivery status updates optimize logistics and enhance transparency.
- **Secure Digital Payments:** UPI and wallet integration for instant, traceable payments to sellers.
- **Community Logistics:** Uses India Post and local networks for efficient delivery.
- **Dashboards:**  
  - *Farmers*: Manage products, orders, chat with customers, and connect to pickup points.
  - *Customers*: Search products, view orders, and chat with farmers.
- **Pre-Order System:** Urban customers place pre-orders a week in advance, and farmers fulfill them for pickup or delivery, ensuring freshness and efficiency[1][2].
